This document explains **multiclass image classification** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 1. Import Necessary Libraries
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
```
•	tensorflow: The main library for building and training deep learning models.
•	layers: Provides various types of layers like Conv2D, Dense, MaxPooling2D, etc., to construct the neural network.
•	models: Provides a way to build models like Sequential for stacking layers.
•	ImageDataGenerator: A utility to load, augment, and preprocess images from directories for training and validation.

2. Set Up Image Preprocessing
```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1.0/255.0,  # Normalize image data
    shear_range=0.2,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    horizontal_flip=True
)

test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0)
```
	•	train_datagen: This applies transformations and augmentations to the training images to help improve generalization:
	•	rescale=1.0/255.0: Normalizes the image pixel values from the range [0, 255] to [0, 1].
	•	shear_range=0.2: Randomly applies shear transformations.
	•	zoom_range=0.2: Randomly zooms into the image.
	•	horizontal_flip=True: Randomly flips the image horizontally for data augmentation.
	•	test_datagen: Only normalizes the pixel values for the test data since we don’t want to augment test images.

3. Load Images from Directories
```python
train_data = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path_to_train_data',
    target_size=(64, 64),  # Resize the images
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'  # For multiclass classification
)

test_data = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'path_to_test_data',
    target_size=(64, 64),  # Resize the images
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'  # For multiclass classification
)```

	•	flow_from_directory():
	•	Loads images from a directory, processes them, and generates batches of images and labels.
	•	target_size=(64, 64): Resizes the images to 64x64 pixels (you can adjust this based on your data).
	•	batch_size=32: Defines how many images are processed in each batch during training.
	•	class_mode='categorical': Indicates multiclass classification. The labels will be one-hot encoded.
	•	train_data: Loads and processes the images for the training dataset.
	•	test_data: Loads and processes the images for the test dataset.

4. Define the CNN Model
```python
model = models.Sequential([
    # First Convolutional Layer
    layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    # Second Convolutional Layer
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),

    # Flatten the output from convolutional layers
    layers.Flatten(),

    # Fully connected layers
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    
    # Output layer for multiclass classification
    layers.Dense(n, activation='softmax')  # Softmax activation for multiclass classification
])```

	•	Sequential(): Creates a linear stack of layers.
	•	First Convolutional Layer:

layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3))

	•	Conv2D: Applies a 2D convolution to the input image to detect patterns like edges or textures.
	•	16: The number of filters (output channels) in the convolution.
	•	(3, 3): The size of the filter is 3x3.
	•	activation='relu': The ReLU activation function adds non-linearity.
	•	input_shape=(64, 64, 3): The input images are 64x64 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).

	•	MaxPooling Layer:

layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))

	•	MaxPooling2D: Reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) by taking the maximum value in each 2x2 region.

	•	Second Convolutional Layer:

layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')

	•	Same as the first convolutional layer, but with 32 filters.

	•	Flatten Layer:

layers.Flatten()

	•	Flatten: Flattens the 2D output from the convolutional layers into a 1D vector, which is necessary for passing it into the fully connected (dense) layer.

	•	Fully Connected Layer:

layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')

	•	Dense: A fully connected layer with 128 neurons.
	•	ReLU activation is used here as well to introduce non-linearity.

	•	Output Layer:

layers.Dense(n, activation='softmax')

	•	Dense(n): The number of neurons is equal to the number of classes (n).
	•	Softmax activation: Converts the raw outputs (logits) into probabilities for each class.

5. Compile the Model
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',  # Categorical cross-entropy for multiclass
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
	•	optimizer=‘adam’: Adam optimizer is used, which is efficient for training deep learning models.
	•	loss=‘categorical_crossentropy’: The loss function used for multiclass classification. It compares the predicted class probabilities with the true one-hot encoded labels.
	•	metrics=[‘accuracy’]: Accuracy will be calculated and displayed during training and evaluation.

6. Model Summary
```python
model.summary()
```
	•	This prints a summary of the model architecture, showing the number of parameters, layer types, and output shapes.

7. Train the Model
```python
history = model.fit(
    train_data,
    epochs=num_epochs,
    validation_data=test_data
)
```
	•	fit(): Starts the training process.
	•	train_data: The input data for training.
	•	epochs=num_epochs: The number of times the entire dataset will be passed through the network.
	•	validation_data=test_data: Used to evaluate the model after each epoch (during training).

8. Evaluate the Model
```python
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy*100:.2f}%")
```
	•	evaluate(): Computes the loss and accuracy of the model on the test data.
	•	It returns the loss and accuracy, which are printed.

Key Concepts:
	•	CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Designed for processing image data, detecting patterns through layers of convolutions and pooling.
	•	Softmax: The output layer activation function for multiclass classification, producing a probability distribution over the classes.
	•	Categorical Cross-Entropy: The loss function used for multiclass classification to measure the difference between the true and predicted class distributions.

Conclusion:

This code sets up a basic CNN model for multiclass image classification. It preprocesses the images, defines a simple CNN model, compiles it, trains it on the data, and evaluates its performance on the test set.
